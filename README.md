# muse-downloader

## Requirements

`php`, `pdftk`, `bash`

## Limitations

Expects PDF currently. Some books on the MUSE site don't have PDF versions, and this will break for them

## WARNING

- This is still WIP, it doesn't combine the PDFs into a single file yet.
- You are responsible for what you do with this. I hate reading online, so I use this to archive and read offline.

## How to run

1. Ensure you have the dependencies covered
2. Put all the book IDs you want in `ids.txt`
